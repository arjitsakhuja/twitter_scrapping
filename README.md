# twitter_scrapping
With free version of Twitter streaming API and search API we can not access data which is beyond 7 days older and there are rate limits as well. Here I have used BeautifulSoup API and Selenium API to scrape as many tweets as you want without any restrictions. Here we can extract tweets based on account, hashtags, fixed phrase and time window as well.
